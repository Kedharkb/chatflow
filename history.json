[{"question": "Can you summarize the document?", "answer": "You need a summary of research in autonomous urban driving, including challenges such as infrastructure costs, training difficulties, and the need to rapidly reconcile conflicting objectives in driving scenarios."}, {"question": "Yes but can you summarize the whole pdf?", "answer": "The PDF file discusses research on autonomous urban driving, focusing on challenges such as training difficulties, infrastructure costs, and the need to reconcile conflicting objectives in driving scenarios rapidly. It compares three approaches for autonomous driving: a modular pipeline, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning, evaluating their performance on various tasks in different towns and weather conditions. The results highlight the importance of generalization in learning-based approaches to sensorimotor control. The document also describes the methods used, such as perception, planning, and continuous control modules, as well as the training process and the evaluation metrics."}, {"question": "What are the training difficulties discussed?", "answer": "The challenges related to training mentioned in the research on autonomous urban driving include infrastructure costs and logistical difficulties of training and testing systems in the physical world. Operating a robotic car requires significant funds and manpower, and collecting data for training and validation is challenging due to the multitude of corner cases that need to be covered. This is true for classic modular pipelines and even more so for data-hungry deep learning techniques. Training and validating sensorimotor control models for urban driving in the physical world are beyond the reach of most research groups."}, {"question": "is there mathematical details provided?", "answer": "Yes, mathematical details are included in the document, particularly in the section discussing the technical details of the autonomous driving systems tested. The training of the semantic segmentation network, intersection classifier network, and local planning for the modular pipeline involve specific mathematical parameters and techniques such as learning rates, epochs, batch sizes, and optimization algorithms like Adam."}]
